        <p>While we do not encourage higher secular educatin for all, we understand that many will need to move onward and we offer very intense math and science courses during the afternoon, for those who want them. Our students who take the SAT, which
            we offer a prep class for in 11th grade, average about a 1200, way above the national average.
